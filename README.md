# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction: ML vs LSTM

This project compares Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM models on their ability to forecast stock prices.

## ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s Included
- Feature engineering for time series (lag features & sequences)
- ML model tuning (GridSearchCV)
- LSTM model architecture with dropout & early stopping
- RMSE & MAE evaluation
- Visualizations (residuals, prediction curves, heatmaps)

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Key Takeaway
LSTM consistently outperformed traditional models in capturing time-based patterns in stock price trends.
